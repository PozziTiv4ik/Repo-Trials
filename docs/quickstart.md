# Quickstart

Two paths. The first proves the whole loop works on a throwaway fixture in a few seconds and
needs no API key, no Docker, and no configuration. The second points RepoTrials at a repository
you actually care about.

!!! danger "Run this against a disposable clone"

    Validation reconstructs historical revisions and **executes their setup scripts and test
    suites** on your machine. Agent commands run with your user's permissions and network access.
    Use a scratch clone with no credentials, ideally inside a VM or container. See the
    [threat model](threat-model.md#v01-security-statement).

## 1. See it work in a few seconds

The bundled demo builds a real two-commit Git repository, mines it, runs BASE/RED/GOLD
validation, then runs a deliberately broken agent and a working agent against the same sealed
task. It ends on a real red-to-green delta and a self-contained HTML report.

=== "One line, no clone"

    Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and network access to the repository. Nothing lands
    in your system Python: uv builds a throwaway environment, runs the demo, and discards the
    environment.

    ```bash
    uvx --with pytest --from git+https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials repotrials demo
    ```

    `--with pytest` is there because the *generated fixture repository* runs pytest, not because
    RepoTrials does. RepoTrials itself has zero runtime dependencies.

=== "Clone and install"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials.git
    cd Repo-Trials
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install ".[dev]"
    repotrials demo
    ```

    The `[dev]` extra is used here only because the generated fixture repository runs pytest. For
    the CLI alone, `python -m pip install .` is enough.

=== "Windows PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials.git
    cd Repo-Trials
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install ".[dev]"
    repotrials demo
    ```

    The CLI runs on Windows, but a local validation there is not evidence of equivalence to the
    Linux evaluation contract. Use matching Docker validation before comparing or exporting.

All three tabs resolve `main`. The `demo` subcommand is not in the v0.1.0 release — see
[Install the CLI](#step-1-install-the-cli) for what each install path does and does not carry.

`repotrials demo --output <empty-dir>` keeps the generated repository somewhere you choose;
`repotrials demo --json` emits the same result as a machine-readable payload.

### Expected output

Abbreviated; the demo prints every CLI call it makes, so it doubles as a smoke test of the public
interface.

```

Measured at 3.9 s wall clock on a warm Linux laptop with the environment already built. The first
`uvx` invocation adds download and build time.

Open the printed `report.html` in a browser. It is a single self-contained file: task and attempt
counts, the resolved count, empirical task-level `pass@k` with a bootstrap 95% confidence
interval, and a per-attempt table with fail-to-pass and pass-to-pass transitions, integrity
result, failure kind, duration, and cost.

### What just happened

1. `mine` scanned the fixture's history and found one commit that changed implementation and
   tests together.
2. `validate` rewound the repository to the parent of that commit, split the commit into a hidden
   test patch and a gold patch, and ran three executions: BASE (old code, old tests) must pass,
   RED (old code, hidden tests) must fail, GOLD (fixed code, hidden tests) must pass.
3. `run` handed each agent a one-commit synthetic repository containing only the pre-fix tree,
   with no later history, no gold patch, and no hidden tests.
4. A separate verifier applied each agent's diff plus the hidden tests and graded the JUnit
   transitions. The no-op agent resolved nothing; the fixing agent resolved the task.

## 2. Run it on your own repository

Supported v0.1 profile: a Git repository with Python tests, and a test command that writes JUnit
XML through the `{junit}` placeholder. Pytest is the default.

### Step 1 — Install the CLI

RepoTrials is not on PyPI: `pip install repotrials` does not work. Three things do — the wheel
attached to the v0.1.0 GitHub Release, the published container, or a source checkout.

=== "Released wheel"

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials/releases/download/v0.1.0/repotrials-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    repotrials --version
    ```

    ```text
    RepoTrials 0.1.0
    ```

    Pure Python, no third-party runtime dependencies. A `SHA256SUMS` file is attached to the same
    release if you want to check the download.

=== "Container"

    Linux/amd64, bundles Git, runs as an unprivileged user, and carries BuildKit provenance and
    an SBOM.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm ghcr.io/pozzitiv4ik/repo-trials:0.1.0 --version
    ```

    ```text
    RepoTrials 0.1.0
    ```

    Pin the digest rather than the tag for an immutable pull:
    `ghcr.io/pozzitiv4ik/repo-trials@sha256:292bf655e882762f2affc3c4c7d1a36ef2a949d2b272ad8d24678601e2516701`.
    Read the mount warning below before pointing it at a repository.

=== "Source"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials.git
    cd Repo-Trials
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install .
    repotrials --version
    ```

    ```text
    RepoTrials 0.1.0
    ```

    This is the path for following `main` or contributing.

=== "uvx, nothing installed"

    ```bash
    uvx --from git+https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials repotrials --version
    ```

    uv builds a throwaway environment from `main` and discards it. Fine for a look; install a
    pinned version before you record a score, because `main` moves.

=== "Windows PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install https://github.com/PozziTiv4ik/Repo-Trials/releases/download/v0.1.0/repotrials-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    repotrials --version
    ```

    ```text
    RepoTrials 0.1.0
    ```

    Swap the install line for `python -m pip install .` inside a clone to build from source. The
    CLI runs on Windows, but a local validation there is not evidence of equivalence to the Linux
    evaluation contract. Use matching Docker validation before comparing or exporting.

The wheel and the container are both built from the v0.1.0 tag, whose CLI is `init`, `doctor`,
`mine`, `candidates`, `validate`, `review`, `export-harbor`, `run`, `report`, `compare`, and
`vault`. Neither has `repotrials demo`; the source and `uvx` paths resolve `main`, which does.

> `repotrials demo` and the `uvx` one-liner above land in the next release. On v0.1.0 the
> equivalent is `python scripts/demo.py` from a source checkout.

!!! warning "The container needs a bind mount, and that mount is the exposure"

    RepoTrials works on a repository on your disk, so the container has to be able to reach it:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm \
      --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      --volume /path/to/scratch-clone-of-your-repo:/workspace \
      ghcr.io/pozzitiv4ik/repo-trials:0.1.0 doctor
    ```

    `--user` is not optional in practice: the image runs as UID 10001, and Git inside it refuses
    a host-owned clone with `detected dubious ownership in repository at '/workspace'`. Matching
    your host UID also leaves `repotrials.toml` and `.repotrials/` owned by you.

    `--volume` hands everything inside the container read/write access to that entire clone: the
    working tree, `.git` with its full history, and `.repotrials/` with the hidden tests and gold
    patches once they exist. Mount the scratch clone and nothing else — no home directory, no SSH
    or cloud credentials, no Docker socket.

    The image carries RepoTrials and Git, not your repository's test toolchain — `pytest` is not
    installed in it. Validating inside it means building your own image `FROM` this one with the
    suite's dependencies added.

    Validating in there is a narrower blast radius than `--unsafe-local` on the host: historical
    setup and tests hit the container filesystem and the mounted clone instead of your whole user
    account. It is still **not a hardened boundary for hostile code**. The container shares the
    host kernel, and the mounted clone is writable from inside it — the same position the
    [threat model](threat-model.md#v01-security-statement) takes on `--backend docker`. For an
    actual boundary, run the whole thing in a disposable VM, or use `export-harbor` and a sandbox
    provider that is one.

### Step 2 — Initialize inside a disposable clone

```bash
cd /path/to/scratch-clone-of-your-repo
repotrials init
```

```text
OK  initialized /path/to/scratch-clone-of-your-repo/repotrials.toml
INFO  Review repotrials.toml, then run `repotrials doctor`.
```

`init` also adds `.repotrials/` to the repository-local Git exclude file. Keep it that way: that
directory holds source snapshots, hidden tests, gold patches, and raw logs.

### Step 3 — Review `repotrials.toml`

This is the step people skip, and it is the step that decides whether mining finds anything and
whether validation can execute what it finds. At minimum check four things:

| Setting | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `test.command` | Must write parseable JUnit XML at `{junit}`. Exit status alone is not enough. |
| `test.setup` | Frozen commands run before every phase. Prefer pinned, already-installed dependencies. |
| `test.source_globs` / `test.test_globs` | Defaults assume `src/**/*.py` and `tests/**/*.py`. A different layout mines zero candidates. |
| `execution.attempts` | Validation **freezes** this budget into every task. `run --attempts` is accepted only when it equals the frozen value, so set it now. |

!!! warning "Run the configured test command by hand before you mine"

    The defaults are `setup = []` and `command = "python -m pytest -q --junitxml={junit}"`. They
    assume the suite is importable from a clean checkout with nothing installed. A `src/` layout
    is the common case where that is false: `python -m pytest` puts the repository root on
    `sys.path`, not `src/`, so collection ends in `ModuleNotFoundError` and every phase exits 2.
    Mining still stores the candidate; `validate` then reports
    `base_failed, gold_failed, no_fail_to_pass` without naming the cause.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/scratch-clone-of-your-repo
    python -m pytest -q     # must collect and pass here before RepoTrials can reproduce anything
    ```

    For a `src/` layout, either tell pytest where the package lives:

    ```toml
    [test]
    command = "python -m pytest -q -o pythonpath=src --junitxml={junit}"
    ```

    or install the project into the evaluation environment:

    ```toml
    [test]
    setup = ["python -m pip install -e ."]
    ```

    The `pythonpath` form needs no network, which matters for `--backend docker`: validation
    containers run with networking disabled.

Start small while you are calibrating:

```toml
[validation]
repeats = 1        # raise to 3+ before trusting a task set

[execution]
attempts = 1       # raise before comparing stochastic agents
```

The full list is in the [configuration reference](configuration.md).

### Step 4 — Check prerequisites

```bash
repotrials doctor
```

```text
RepoTrials doctor
OK  git: /usr/bin/git
OK  docker: /usr/bin/docker
OK  harbor: not found (optional; export does not require it)
OK  repository: /path/to/scratch-clone-of-your-repo
OK  state: /path/to/scratch-clone-of-your-repo/.repotrials
```

`doctor` exits non-zero if a required check fails.

### Step 5 — Mine candidates

Bound the first pass. A full history scan on a large repository is slow and you do not yet know
whether your globs are right.

```bash
repotrials mine --limit 100
repotrials candidates
```

```text
OK  stored 1 candidate(s), including 1 new
Candidates (1)
ID                              commit     source  tests  lines  title
------------------------------  ---------  ------  -----  -----  --------------------------------------------------
candidate-9a64148473302a0bc248  50055c2a1  1       1      7      Fix floating point cart total with regression test
```

`--since 12.months.ago` is the other useful bound. Plain `mine` is entirely local; only
`mine --github` makes a network call.

!!! info "`stored 0 candidate(s)` is the most common first result"

    Mining is deliberately conservative. A commit is rejected when it touches more than
    `mining.max_files` paths, changes more than `mining.max_changed_lines` lines, includes a
    binary or renamed file, matches no `test.source_globs` path, or matches no `test.test_globs`
    path. In v0.1 the command reports success with a zero count and does not yet break the total
    down by reason.

    Work through it in this order: confirm your source and test globs match the real directory
    layout, then raise `mining.max_files` and `mining.max_changed_lines`, then widen `--limit` or
    `--since`. Repositories whose bug fixes rarely ship with a test in the same commit will
    genuinely yield very few tasks — see the [FAQ](faq.md).

### Step 6 — Validate and accept

```bash
repotrials validate --accept --unsafe-local
```

```text
OK  candidate-9a64148473302a0bc248: valid
```

`--unsafe-local` is a required acknowledgement that historical setup and tests execute with your
host permissions. It is not a sandbox switch. For containerized validation use
`--backend docker` with a pinned image; Docker narrows the blast radius but is still not a
boundary for hostile code.

Invalid candidates print their rejection reasons instead, and the command exits non-zero.

!!! warning "`base_failed` on the first attempt means the base tree could not run its own tests"

    ```text
    WARN  candidate-297aacc5a9c85534b185: base_failed, gold_failed, no_fail_to_pass
    ```

    Reasons are not ranked, and later ones are usually consequences of the first. `base_failed`
    means `test.command` did not pass on the untouched pre-fix tree, before any patch was applied
    — so nothing downstream of it can succeed. On a `src/` layout it is almost always collection
    failing with `ModuleNotFoundError`, because nothing put the package on the path. Add whatever
    your contributors run to `test.setup` and revalidate.

    Known gap: v0.1 does not persist the phase logs, so `validate` cannot show you the traceback.
    `repotrials --json review` records the per-phase exit codes (`baseline_exit_codes`,
    `red_exit_codes`, `gold_exit_codes`), which tell you whether the suite ran and failed or never
    ran at all. To see the output itself, run the phase by hand:

    ```bash
    repotrials --json candidates          # note the candidate's parent_sha
    git worktree add --detach /tmp/rt-base <parent_sha>
    cd /tmp/rt-base && python -m pytest -q --junitxml=/tmp/rt.xml
    ```

### Step 7 — Review before you trust the numbers

Execution proves a task is reproducible and discriminating. It cannot prove the task is *fair* —
that a reasonable agent could infer, from the prompt alone, the interface the hidden test
demands. So accepted tasks land in tier `auto`, and promotion is a separate human decision.

```bash
repotrials review
```

```text
Tasks (1)
ID                       tier  candidate                       instruction
-----------------------  ----  ------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
rt_1d07d86f4524da53e827  auto  candidate-9a64148473302a0bc248  Fix floating point cart total with regression test\x0a\x0aFix floating point
```

`\x0a` is the table's own escaping of a newline, not corruption in the prompt: instructions are
multi-line, and the triage table flattens control characters so that untrusted repository text
cannot forge rows in your terminal or CI log. The column is a hard 70-character cut with no
ellipsis.

The plain table is triage, not a review interface. Use `repotrials --json review` together with
the recorded candidate, validation, and source diff, and apply the
[human review rubric](methodology.md#human-review-rubric). Then promote:

```bash
repotrials review --verify rt_1d07d86f4524da53e827
```

```text
OK  updated 1 task(s)
```

!!! note "Global flags come before the subcommand"

    `--root` and `--json` belong to the top-level parser: write `repotrials --json review`, not
    `repotrials review --json`.

### Step 8 — Run an agent

`--agent-command` is the entire integration surface. The command runs inside the task workspace
and receives `REPOTRIALS_WORKSPACE`, `REPOTRIALS_INSTRUCTION`, `REPOTRIALS_INSTRUCTION_PATH`, and
`REPOTRIALS_TASK_ID`; `{workspace}` and `{instruction}` expand to those paths. Whatever the
command leaves in the working tree is the submission.

```bash
repotrials run \
  --agent-command "my-agent --workspace {workspace} --prompt {instruction}" \
  --name my-agent-baseline \
  --unsafe-local
```

```text
OK  run my-agent-baseline-20260815-083343-5ce2a4: 1/3 trials resolved
```

Copy that run-group identifier. It is the stable handle for reports and comparisons; a bare agent
label can match several historical groups and is rejected as an ambiguous cohort.

Worked invocations for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Aider, and others are in [Agents](agents.md).

### Step 9 — Report and compare

```bash
repotrials report my-agent-baseline-20260815-083343-5ce2a4 --output .repotrials/reports/baseline
```

```text
OK  report written to .repotrials/reports/baseline/report.html
```

Run a second configuration under a different `--name`, then put the two cohorts side by side:

```bash
repotrials compare noop-agent-20260815-083343-5ce2a4 fix-agent-20260815-083343-00c22d
```

```text
noop-agent-20260815-083343-5ce2a4 → fix-agent-20260815-083343-00c22d
baseline  candidate  delta      paired tasks
--------  ---------  ---------  ------------
0.0%      100.0%     +100.0 pp  1
```

`compare` refuses two cohorts unless their task sets, task-content digests, task-contract
digests, attempt shapes, and execution profiles match. Add `--fail-on-regression 5pp` to make it
exit 1 when the candidate drops by more than five percentage points — that is the CI gate, and
[CI](ci.md) shows it in a workflow.

## Housekeeping

```bash
repotrials vault verify        # hash-check every stored oracle object
```

- Never commit or publish `.repotrials/`. Only `report.json` and `report.html` are safe to share.
- Record the model revision, agent revision, prompt and tool configuration, budgets, the
  run-group identifier, and the RepoTrials version alongside any score you quote.
- One or two tasks is not a benchmark. The report prints a task count and a bootstrap 95%
  confidence interval next to `pass@k` precisely so a thin result looks thin.

## Next steps

- [Agents](agents.md) — verified invocations for real command-line coding agents.
- [CI](ci.md) — gate a pull request on an agent regression.
- [Configuration](configuration.md) — every key, with defaults.
- [Methodology](methodology.md) — what the score means and where it stops meaning anything.
- [FAQ](faq.md) — contamination, cost, non-Python repositories, and the rest of the hard questions.
